<b>
sql view with demo data ,example code and result
</b>

Let's say we have a table called "Employees" with the following columns: "EmployeeID", "FirstName", "LastName", "DepartmentID", and "Salary". We want to create a view that shows the employee details along with the department name. Here's how you can do it:

1. Create the "Employees" table and insert some sample data:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
  EmployeeID INT,
  FirstName VARCHAR(50),
  LastName VARCHAR(50),
  DepartmentID INT,
  Salary DECIMAL(10,2)
);

INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, DepartmentID, Salary)
VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe', 1, 50000.00),
       (2, 'Jane', 'Smith', 1, 60000.00),
       (3, 'Bob', 'Johnson', 2, 55000.00),
       (4, 'Alice', 'Williams', 2, 65000.00);

CREATE TABLE Departments (
  DepartmentID INT,
  DepartmentName VARCHAR(50)
);

INSERT INTO Departments (DepartmentID, DepartmentName)
VALUES (1, 'IT'),
       (2, 'HR');

```

1. Create a view called "EmployeeDetails" that includes the employee details and the department name:

```sql
CREATE VIEW EmployeeDetails AS
SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.FirstName, e.LastName, d.DepartmentName, e.Salary
FROM Employees as e
JOIN Departments as d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID;

```

1. Retrieve data from the view:

```sql
SELECT * FROM EmployeeDetails;

```

The expected result would be:

```diff
+------------+-----------+----------+---------------+-----------+
| EmployeeID | FirstName | LastName | DepartmentName|   Salary  |
+------------+-----------+----------+---------------+-----------+
|     1      |   John    |   Doe    |   IT          |  50000.00 |
|     2      |   Jane    |  Smith   |   IT          |  60000.00 |
|     3      |   Bob     | Johnson  |   HR          |  55000.00 |
|     4      |   Alice   | Williams |   HR          |  65000.00 |
+------------+-----------+----------+---------------+-----------+

```

The "EmployeeDetails" view combines data from the "Employees" table and the "Departments" table (assuming there's another table called "Departments" with columns "DepartmentID" and "DepartmentName"). It provides a convenient way to retrieve the employee details along with the corresponding department name without having to join the tables each time.
